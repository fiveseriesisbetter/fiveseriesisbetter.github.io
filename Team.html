					Why did you join Cal ACLU: I remember attending a Cal ACLU meeting as a freshman back when I was thinking of joining. At the end of the meeting, someone really disruptive walked into the room and out of nowhere began arguing with one of the club's board members. A few insults in, the disruptor said an all too familiar line riddled with xenophobia "but...where are you even from?" Without a moment's hesitation, three members of the club's executive board got up from their seats and stepped in, asking the man if there was a problem. It was second nature for them to shut down any and all instances of intolerance, and after watching that I understood the true character of Cal ACLU, one of strength. It takes great courage to stand up for others, and, whether it's a bigoted comment addressed at one person or a xenophobic political policy targeting millions, too many of us look the other way in the face of evil. After four years in this club, I know I was not wrong in my assessment, and I've met who I believe to be some of the most courageous and passionate students on campus.

					Year: Senior <br>
					Why did you join Cal ACLU: I joined Cal ACLU during my first weeks at Berkeley freshman year and really fell in love with the work. Coming from a family of Iranian refugees I remember my parents excitedly updating me on how the ACLU was working for us, protecting our rights too. This was post 2001 when, with our background, it was easy to feel unwanted in this country. I personally saw the impact that an organization like this can have: it stands with those who might not always feel like they are protected. I knew I wanted to give this same feeling of value and protection to others and Cal ACLU gave me that opportunity.

					Year: Senior <br>
					Why did you join Cal ACLU:
					I was first introduced to the ACLU by watching the movie Loving about the landmark Supreme Court case Loving v. Virginia, which ACLU lawyers represented the Loving couple in, and was then attracted to this long and successful history of the organization. Also, I had been hearing a lot about their lawsuits against Trump the whole year leading up to starting at Cal, and I knew I wanted to be a part of an organization that dedicated itself to defending the rights of Americans no matter how big their opponent.

					Why did you join Cal ACLU:
					The ACLU has been a major inspiration for me for most of my life, and I came to Cal in part for the atmosphere of advocacy and the social justice focus among the students. Showing up on campus as a Freshman and seeing that the Cal ACLU was an extracurricular offering was an opportunity I absolutely could not pass up! Ever since, the Cal ACLU community has been a beautiful addition to UC Berzerkeley :)
