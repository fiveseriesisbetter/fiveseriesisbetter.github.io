		<h3 style = "padding-top: 3%">An Imperfect American Trifecta: Slavery, Segregation, and Mass Incarceration</h3>
		<p> By: Nadia Kazempoor </p>
    <p style = "text-align: left"> The United States of America prides itself as a reliable champion of human rights, with American presidents like Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama convincing the public, both at home and abroad, of the United States’ allegiance to the human rights movement. However, this facade is entirely superficial. Since its inception, the United States of America has been built on the convenience of human rights violations, specifically against an African-American minority that it deems inferior. It is time to discuss the gross negligence of the international community and its abundantly capable actors in responding to three, inter-connected mass atrocities in modern history, all of which occured and contine to occur in the United States: being the American slave trade, racial segregation prior to the American Civil Rights movement, and finally, the current American mass incarceration crisis.
      </p>
    <p style = "text-align: left"> As early as 1776, synonymous with the birth of the new nation, the United States of America, alongside most of the Western world, engaged in a violation of human rights so grand that minmial atonement can be made centuries later: the slave trade. Though the American slave trade faced a gradual end in the estimated year of 1862, the failure of the United States to cease their abuses against African-American slaves, as well as the international community’s failure to intervene on their behalf, plagues the savior complex that the United States aims so desperately to maintain. The US was no where near the sole villain in the narrative that was 19th century slavery, though it is without a doubt that a key player, and arguably, a leader. One of many causes for American slavery, as well as the international community’s failure to speak out against the horrors encapsulated in the slave trade, resides in an unbreakable sense of superiority and benevolence rampant throughout members of the white race. The white man’s burden,
coupled with a belief in white supremacy, allowed for Americans to justify their horrific treatment of African-American slaves, despite their devotion to the good Christian faith. Failure on the part of the international community to intervene can be raced back to their very own interests in the same slave trade, though the US was notoriously less discreet of their aptitude to human rights violations against their enslaved. Although it would be more idealistic to assume that the evils of American slavery emerged out of a ridiculous sense of moral and racial superiority of the white master, the reality is that slavery was a tool of American capitalism. The unwillingness of both the American government, as well as most of the international community, to intervene in the American slave trade rests partly on the nation’s unplanned dependence on slave labor as a means of economic growth and progress. Though the international community, specifically the West, aims to set the perception that they are not economically motivated and manipulatable, the reality is clear: so long as the slave trade brought forth profit to the states that legalized it, no amount of outcry against the gross human rights violations against the enslaved would be anything more than a plea to the perpetuator. Though the American slave trade’s causes can be traced to both moral convictions, like the white man’s burden, and economic necessity, in the form of cheap slave labor, the failure of the international community to intervene against the obvious human rights violations rampant in the American slave trade comes down to a simple disregard of the enslaved as humans worthy of the promises and protections of human rights.

  Though American slavery was formally eradicated in the mid-1800s with President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Declaration, white Americans desperate to retain their sense of racial superiority soon crafted a modern form of slavery even easier to mask from the international public: racial segregation. Until the eruption of the Civil Rights Movement in the
 1960s, racial segregation became a nuanced way for former American slave masters to exert the moral and white supremacy they so desperately clung the entirity of their self worth onto. Expectedly, the American Civil War gravely harmed North-South relations in the United States; so much so, that there seemed to be an impenetrable divide between two opposing sides of the American landscape, ultimately allowing for a gaping social cleavage just wide enough for the mistreatment of African-Americans through segregation to squeeze into. With the distraction of regional tensions and animosities, alongside a post-World War II general skepticism, it became difficult for Americans to acknowledge that American racism was more of a threat to domestic harmony than Russian communism, for example. Though the end of World War II brought forth an air of relief in the United States, new conflicts in the Cold War, as well as the growing consequences of President Harry Truman’s abuse of nuclear weapons, brought forth a desperate need in America for a scapegoat to channel their frustrations onto. No one was easier to blame than the African-American, as white supremacy was still very much deep-rooted in the hearts of virtually all white Americans, whether they knew it or not. The international community, busied by attempts to repair a world order deeply damaged by the disasters of World War II and the horrors of the Holocaust, found little interest in adding another human rights cause to its arsenal of minorities to save. Here lies the very problem in the human rights arena: the assumption that victims of human rights violations are to be saved enables the white savior complex that so dangerously formed in the plight of abolition. The international community, made up of its predominantly white, colonial, Western powers, did not intervene on the behalf of American segregation and racism, because they saw no harm in the forceful divide on the basis of race, though they would scarcely admit to it in public. On paper, the international community and its actors of states and institutions might have condemned the United States for its segregation and

horrific treatment of African-Americans, but in private, the Western powers would applaud the United States for carrying out the grave human rights violations they, themselves, aim to hide from the international public’s eye, and therefore, scrutiny. Afterall, the American tendency to violate human rights when it comes to minorities like African-Americans can be traced back to the fact that “the white man is more afraid of separation than he is of integration” (Malcolm X 17). In the historic Supreme Court case of Plessy vs. Ferguson, the separate but equal doctrine was established in an attempt to do precisely as Malcolm X theorized: force separation, in order to avoid integration. It all comes down to control for the white man. Segregation was a desperate attempt for white Americans to regain control over the African-American minority they felt cheated out of enslaving. The separate but equal doctrine, with its formal language and scarily convincing arguments, showed to the international community that the United States of America knew how to cover up their human rights violations with ease, therefore lifting the responsibility and accountability that international actors felt to intervene. In the eyes of the Western superpowers, if the United States could contain the reports of lynchings and murders to their national news only, then there was no necessity for international intervention to take place. This in itself prompted one of the greatest failures of the international community in failing to intervene in instances of historical American human rights violations: their complacence.

  Thankfully, racial segregation came to a forceful “end” in 1964 with President Lyndon B. Johnson’s approval of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as well as President John F. Kennedy’s, arguably superficial, support of the Civil Rights Movement. However, history often repeats itself. The same way that slavery was amended to create segregation, the intermix of both slavery and segregation was manipulated in order to create what is arguably the most grave human rights crisis in the United States today: mass incarceration. The white American is more desperate than
 ever to retain its racial supremacy and unwavering control over minorities like African-Americans, as liberal advocacy and human rights reform slowly begin to challenge the validity of the argument of white supremacy. The descendants of American slave masters have taken to a new form of slavery in mass incarceration, weaponizing the prison system against minorities in a manner that horrifically encapsulates both racial and class tensions in the United States. Though it is true that both slavery and segregation are, and have been for decades, outlawed in the United States, an American criminal has about the same place in society as a fugitive slave in the height of American Antebellum, or a middle class black man stuck in the times of Jim Crow. Racism is a parasite immensely difficult to remove from a host, without destroying the integrity of its person. Therefore, the learned nature of American racism is an entirely different breed than the dictionary denotation that is used in mass, for American racism is interconnected with nationalism and personal pride in a manner that is both threatening and unbreakable. Though 19th century slave masters fought for slavery in the Civil War as a manner of nationalism, and white Americans demanded segregation in the 1960s as an attempt to salvage their personal pride, the present system of mass incarceration that disproportionately affects African-Americans is a grave human rights violation of its own nature, for the white perpetuators who call for “thugs” to get locked up, or allow for the existence of a prison-industrial complex, are not acting out of nationalism or pride like their ancestors, but rather, are acting almost entirely out of malice and intent to destory an entire race’s reputation in the country they were born into. White Americans villainize the black man for the color of his skin, destroy any opportunity he has for a life deemed acceptable by the perpetrator’s standards, then feigns shock when he finds himself in a grave of incarceration that was specifically dug for “his kind.” The sneaky manipulation of justice found within American mass incarceration and modern racial

villanization is arguably one of the most terrifying human rights violations the world has, and will ever see. Yet, international intervention is destitute, for the tricky nature of mass incarceration was purposefully created in an attempt to blend the lines of civil and human rights in a manner that makes international intervention not only difficult, but virtually impossible. The easy evolution of American human rights violations against African-Americans is both dangerous, and angering, for this form of evolution can only occur if an environment permits it to occur. The international community is meant to be the stabilizing force of actors like the United States, and it is precisely the international community who is partly at fault for the centuries of grievances African-Americans have faced at the hands of the government meant to protect and respect them. Racism may be a probable cause for the human rights violations enacted by the United States since its inception, but it is surely not an excuse.

  Slavery, segregation, and mass incarceration all hold two factors in common: their perpetuator and their victim. The United States of America, specifically being the white American serves as the link between three of the most horrific human rights violations the United States has ever seen. The interconnectedness of slavery, segregation, and mass incarceration is not a revelation to be celebrated; rather, the fact that not one, not two, but three separate instances of evil and inhumanity can, and have, occured against a single minority is a failure for the entire international community to shoulder, and mourn. Though the United States of America is the perpetuator responsible for the horrific treatment of African-Americans throughout its nation’s history, the punishment is clear for the American government and its people: the blood of African-Americans will forever remain in the forefront of American history. It is the international community, however, that must be held accountable for their failure to intervene, their failure to speak out, and finally, their failure to act differently than the singular
villain they claim the United States to be by its own accord. The United States may be a monster, but the international community is its creator.
